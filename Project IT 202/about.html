      <h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
      <p class="des">Puff's Book Store was founded on June 12, 2016 by our owner David Villafranca.
         Realizing his town's need for a book store, he took up shop in the downtown section of Spader.
         Upon opening, many of the towns people and people from surrounding towns flock to his store to
         read a book or purchase a new book just released.
